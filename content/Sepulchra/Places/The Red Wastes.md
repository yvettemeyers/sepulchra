Between the borders of [[Hyperium]] and [[Jotunkeppa]] lie the Red Wastes, a barren desert scorched by traditional and magical warfare alike over the abundance of [[Dreamsalt|dreamsalt]] deposits in the area. Through unknown means, the horrific violence in the area has corrupted the deposits, creating red [[Corrupted Dreamsalt|corrupted dreamsalt]] that dot the desert landscape in tall, crimson spires. Some say the bloodshed has cursed the latent psychic energy within, and attempts to channel the dreamsalt into dreamglass or enhanced spellcraft have resulted in unpredictable, explosive magical accidents.
