The party began as members of the [[Divyani Mercenary Company]] working under [[Captain Vern Wick]], all looking to seek their fortune to compensate for copious debts.

- [[Mr. Magic]] is destitute after losing his previous magic act partner, due to his partner obtaining actual magic power.

- [[Lucario]] is seeking refuge after the destruction of his hometown left him without a place to call home.
- [[Beebo]] is seeking __
- [[Kalhia]] is traveling across the continent in search of the person who dreamed them into existence.

The party traveled through [[The Red Wastes]] in a camelphant caravan with two corso carriages to accompany them before coming across a large [[Corrupted Dreamsalt|corrupted dreamsalt]] canyon, where they were ambushed by warriors in [[Oristje|Oristjen]] rebel garb.

During the battle, another group dressed in Oristjen rebel garb also ambushed the caravan, but did not expect the first rebel group to be there. In the confusion and cross fighting, the party were able to escape with the camelphant carriage and one of the corso carriages, though they lost the supply carriage in the fighting. However despite their victory, when Vern Wick went to check on the cargo, the camelphant carriage was mysteriously empty.

Looking back at the party's path across the red sand dunes, a trail can be seen splitting off from the party's tracks and heading into the desert towards locations unknown.
